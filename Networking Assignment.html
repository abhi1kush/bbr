<h1>Tweaking TCP<br>
</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Internet users are dependent upon the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</a>
for reliable transmission of data in a heterogeneous and unreliable
global network. Many Internet applications could not function without
TCP. In recent years, some Internet service providers (ISPs) have <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-throttles-bittorrent-traffic-seeding-impossible/">exploited</a>
inherent characteristics and vulnerabilities of TCP to selectively
restrict or eliminate traffic flowing over their networks, particularly
traffic related to the BitTorrent P2P file sharing service. Although
such restrictions can be avoided by <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-bypass-comcast-bittorrent-throttling-071021/">technical means</a> in some cases and through <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9905096-7.html?tag=cd.blog">negotiation</a> in others, computer scientists have been reminded of the importance and limitations of currently deployed TCP implementations.<br>
<br>
In this assignment you will explore the performance limitations of TCP
by experimenting with commonly deployed algorithms using a simulated
network. For ambitious students, an extra credit section related
to&nbsp;TCP security vulnerabilities is offered at the end of the
assignment. (A good introduction to <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/3072">TCP in the context of security</a> may be of interest to all students.)
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Part 1: Installation and Configuration of Linux on VirtualPC</span></h2>

Because it provides a rich variety of OS components and utilities for
measuring and optimizing network performance, we will be using Linux
for this assignment. Specifically, the assignment was written with the
Ubuntu 7.10 distribution in mind, which is based on release 2.6.22 of
the Linux kernel. We assume that most students will run Ubuntu within
VirtualPC, but those wishing to run Linux directly on their own
hardware are free to do so.<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">
A) Install Ubuntu within VirtualPC</span></h3>
A good tutorial for installing Ubuntu on Virtual PC is available <a href="http://arcanecode.wordpress.com/2007/10/18/installing-ubuntu-710-under-virtual-pc-2007/">here</a>. After completing the installation per the tutorial, a few additional steps are required.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Access</span><br>
<br>
Your installation might not have network or Internet access without some tweaking. Do the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>In the VirtualPC menu, select Edit-&gt;Settings. Within the
settings, select Networking. Alter Adapter 1 to Shared Networking (NAT).</li>
  <li>Within Ubuntu, click on network icon (looks like two overlayed terminals) in upper right corner. Select wired connection.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Updating apt-get</span><br>

<br>
You will use the apt-get utility to retrieve source code and binaries
necessary for this assignment. apt-get may require some configuration:<br>
<ul>
  <li>You may need to uncomment several lines in /etc/apt/sources.list.
Uncomment all of the addresses except those in the "backports" section
and those in the final section.</li>
  <li>Run "sudo apt-get update" &nbsp;in a terminal.</li>
</ul>
In general, if apt-get is unable to retrieve an application that you
need for this assignment, you might try uncommenting additional lines
in the sources file and running update again.<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">
B) Configure and Compile the Linux Kernel</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Follow <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile">this tutorial</a>
for downloading, configuring, and compiling the Linux kernel. (Do this
within the VirtualPC/Ubuntu installation you created in part A.) Use
the "Alternate Build Method." Observe the following caveats:<br>
<ul>
  <li>In addition to libcurses5, also install libcurses5-dev</li>
  <li>Prior to running "make menuconfig", run "make mrproper"</li>
  <li>The remaining instructions assume you use&nbsp;menuconfig rather than xconfig</li>
  <li>When running make-kpkg, we recommend against use of the --append-to-version option</li>
</ul>
During configuration, you will need to enable several modules related
to networking.&nbsp;That is, in fact, why we are compiling the kernel;
they are not enabled with the default distribution.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set "General setup -&gt; local version" to an appropriate word or
number. (This is simply so that you can distinguish your version of the
kernel from others)</li>
  <li>Enable "Networking -&gt; Networking options -&gt; Network testing -&gt; TCP Connection Probing" as a module</li>
  <li>Enable "Networking -&gt; Networking options&nbsp;-&gt; QoS and/or fair queuing -&gt; Network Emulator" as a module</li>
  <li>Enable "Networking -&gt; Networking options -&gt; TCP: advanced congestion control" as built-in</li>
</ul>
Within TCP: advanced congestion control, enable all options as modules, including cubic, as shown below:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
<img src="./Networking Assignment_files/tcpmods.PNG" alt="tcpmods.PNG"><br>
<br>
Resume the tutorial, and follow the instructions for building and
installing the new kernel. After installing the kernel but prior to
restarting, you should repeat the steps in the tutorial from part 1.A
to fix your mouse configuration in /boot/grub/menu.lst. This time, fix
both the generic kernel and the new kernel you just installed.<br>
<br>
Restart your system, and use grub to select your new kernel. (You may
want to make a copy of your virtual Ubuntu installation before doing
this.) Cross your fingers! If your kernel fails to boot, contact anyone
but the author of this assignment.<br>
<br>
Assuming your kernel boots without error, you should install iperf, an
application you will need shortly. You may also want gnuplot. As root
(#), type:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># apt-get install iperf</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># atp-get install gnuplot</span></div>

<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Part 2: TCP Performance Maximization</span></h2>
Networks can be hostile environments. A variety of obstacles may face
network traffic as it makes its way from source to destination,
including physical limitations, competition from other network users,
unpredictable routing, equipment failure, manipulation by service
providers, and deliberate attempts at disruption from malicious users.
A variety of techniques have been proposed and implemented to support
the reliable transmission of data via unreliable networks. Of these TCP
is perhaps the most prominent example. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, no solution provides optimal performance under all
network conditions. In this part of the assignment you will study the
performance of different TCP configurations under a variety of network
conditions. In particular, we will focus on the choice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Reno">congestion avoidance algorithm</a>
(henceforth CA). These algorithms control the rate at which data is
transmitted by altering important parameters of &nbsp;TCP, notably the <span style="font-style: italic;">congestion window</span> (cwnd) and the <span style="font-style: italic;">slow-start threshold </span>(ssthresh).
This is done by approximating the characteristics of the network,
chiefly by extrapolating from the reliability, speed, or order in which
acknowledgment packets are received by the sender. However, exact
network characteristics are impossible to determine using this limited
information,&nbsp;forcing algorithm designers to make some assumptions.
Accordingly, different algorithms are suited to different network
conditions.<br>
<br>
Hopefully you have already downloaded and installed the tools necessary
to complete this part of the assignment, as instructed in Part 1.B. We
will be using iperf to generate TCP traffic with known characteristics,
and to take high level measurements of effective bandwidth. Additional
measurements will be recorded using the tcpprobe module. The netem
module will be used in conjunction with tc to perform high-level
network emulation. This will allow you to conduct your performance
evaluation entirely on localhost. Finally Linux's /proc virtual file
system will be used to alter TCP parameters, such as the choice of CA,
as previously discussed. Basic usage of these tools is discussed below,
and some samples are provided to get you started. Some of these
examples require root permission, so it is assumed that you are either
logged in as root or you are using sudo. Commands requiring root access
are generally distinguished via the "#" prompt, versus the "&gt;"
prompt for typical user access.<br>
<br>
This section of the assignment was heavily influenced by a good <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/135/pfeiffer.html">Linux Gazette article</a>
by Rene Pfeiffer. It is highly recommended that you read it prior to
tackling this section. The article links to other useful sites that are
referenced as appropriate below.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Using iperf and tcpprobe</span><br>
<br>
You will need to invoke <a href="http://dast.nlanr.net/Projects/Iperf/">iperf</a>
repeatedly via a script in order to conduct your performance
evaluation, so you should become comfortable with its basic
functionality. To start an iperf server using the default port of 5001,
open a terminal, and type:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&gt; iperf -s</span><br>
<br>
Then in a second terminal, type:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&gt; iperf -t 10 -c localhost</span><br>
<br>
The command above tells iperf to transmit data to the receiver on
localhost :5001 for 10 seconds. iperf will repeatedly send a
default-sized buffer of data to the receiver at the fastest reliable
rate allowed by TCP and network conditions. At the end of 10 seconds, a
summary including average bandwidth achieved will be printed.
&nbsp;Since you're transmitting from localhost to localhost, bandwidth
should be pretty high! iperf includes a variety of options for
controlling buffer size, port, reporting interval, etc. Check out the
man page for more information:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&gt; man iperf</span><br>
<br>
One important iperf parameter deserves an explanation: -M, controlling
maximum segment size (mss), the amount of data that can be included in
a single packet. Normally this is restricted by the physical layer used
for transmission, at around 1460 bits for Ethernet, for example. Since
our tests will be conducted entirely on localhost, you will need to
artificially restrict the mss. It is therefore <span style="font-weight: bold;">essential</span> that you begin iperf commands used for final evaluation with:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&gt; iperf -M 1500</span><br>
<br>
This will probably result in a warning indicating that a smaller mss
was assigned; ignore this warning. You can confirm that an mss of close
to 1500 bits is achieved during transmission by appending the -m
option, which prints the mss.<br>
<br>
We can obtain more detailed information about TCP performance using
tcpprobe. Prior to starting your performance evaluation, &nbsp;type:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># modprobe tcp_probe port=5001</span><br>
<br>
You only need to do this once; the module will remain installed
throughout your tests. tcpprobe reports (among other things) the cwnd
and ssthresh values in effect for each packet transmitted on localhost.
The rest of its functionality and implementation we'll leave as
"magic".&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A good <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Net:TCP_testing">overview</a>
of TCP testing using these tools is available. It includes a link to
some scripts that you might find useful.You may use these scripts if
you like; just mention where they came from in your report. A more
tailored variant of the main script intended for use with this
assignment is linked to later on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Using tc and netem</span><br>
<br>
The tc tool (short for traffic control) offers a variety of ways to
control network transmissions emanating from each network device,
including localhost. A full tutorial on tc is beyond the scope of this
assignment, but additional information is available via<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&gt; man tc</span><br>
<br>
Chiefly we will be using the netem module, described <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Net:Netem">here</a>.
This tool allows us to model common adverse network conditions. It
allows delays, such as those that occur when a client is communicating
with a distant server, and random packet loss, which is especially
common in wireless networks. It is possible to model fairly complex
behavior via netem (at least insofar as the distributions of delays and
packet loss are concerned), but we will be using the basics. Consider
the following 3 example commands:<br>
<br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">#&nbsp;tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 50ms</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">#&nbsp;tc qdisc show</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">#&nbsp;tc qdisc del dev lo root netem</span><br>
<br>
Netem is a kind of tc "qdisc", or queuing discipline. The first command <span style="font-style: italic;">adds</span> to the <span style="font-style: italic;">device</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">"loopback"</span> (localhost) at the <span style="font-style: italic;">root</span> an instance of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">netem</span> that <span style="font-style: italic;">delays</span>
transmissions by 50 ms. The second command should show you which qdiscs
are installed for each device on your system, so that you can verify
the first command worked. The final command <span style="font-style: italic;">deletes</span>
the netem you installed in the first step. This is important, since you
can only install one netem per device at a time, and you will need to
alter the configuration to conduct your tests.<br>
<br>
tc allows for chaining of qdiscs, which enables some more complicated
network configurations. In particular, we can add a tbf (token bucket
filter) to enforce bandwidth limitations similar to those imposed by
network administrators or Internet service providers. In our
experience, the use of tbf is rather finicky.&nbsp;The example below
combines netem and tbf to construct a "realistic" scenario for
uploading data to a distant server via a cable modem restricted to 512
Kbit/sec, with a small probability of random packet loss. You may copy
the commands below verbatim for use in your tests:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: netem delay 100ms loss 0.1%</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1: tbf rate 512kbit buffer 10k latency 10ms</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Congestion Avoidance and Other TCP Parameters via /proc and sysctl</span><br>
<br>
One of the more useful features of Linux is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">/proc virtual file system</a>.
It allows users to read and (in some cases) modify parameters used by
the kernel, including the choice of CA algo used by TCP. Although it is
possible to read and write /proc files directly, we will do so using
the sysctl command, which is a bit cleaner:<br>
<br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># sysctl&nbsp;net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=cubic</span><br>
<br>
The first command returns the current CA, which should be reno by
default in the Linux configuration from part 1.B. The second command
sets the CA to cubic, which is the default CA for the precompiled
version of Ubuntu you installed initially. You should use the second
command to switch between CAs during your tests.<br>
<br>
TCP is sensitive to a few other settings that we won't explain in
detail. You should run the following commands prior to conducting your
tests:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save=1</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=4096 16384 10000000</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"># sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 10000000</span><br>
<br>
The first command should disable caching of cwnd and ssthresh
parameters between TCP connections, which could lead to early tests
influencing the results of later tests. [NOTE: Unfortunately, this does
not seem to work reliably. Don't worry too much if your results
indicate caching.] The other commands increase the maximum size of the
cwnd, as the default maximum is fairly conservative.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Tests</span><br>
<br>
Finally, you're ready to conduct your TCP performance evaluation! We
will restrict our evaluation to the reno, cubic, htcp and veno CAs.
Evaluate each algorithm under the following simulated network
conditions:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Default localhost (no artificial delay or loss)</li>
  <li>Delay 50 ms</li>
  <li>Delay 100 ms</li>
  <li>Delay 200 ms</li>
  <li>Delay 100 ms with 0.1% random packet loss</li>
  <li>Delay 100 ms with&nbsp;1% random packet loss</li>
  <li>Delay 100 ms with 10% random packet loss</li>
  <li>"512 Kbit/sec Cablemodem" configuration (using tbf) given earlier</li>
</ol>
Use iperf to run each test for at least 60 seconds.&nbsp;Save the
output from the sending side of iperf to a file. You should also use
tcpprobe to collect data during each test. <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sdb7e/os_project/caTestTemplate.sh">This script</a>
provides a template that includes capture of tcpprobe data, and runs
each of the CAs in turn. You must fill in the sections marked TODO. In
addition to this script, we recommend that you write a second "main"
script that invokes tc to create the 8 test cases. This script should
call your filled in version of the template script once for each test
case.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What to Hand In</span><br>
<br>
Create a summary chart (or charts) that compares the effective
bandwidth achieved by each algorithm for each test case. On the basis
of this chart and your experience during experimentation, produce a
report that answer the following questions:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Do the algorithms perform as expected given their design criteria?</li>
  <li>Which algorithm(s) performed best in case (4)? In case (7)? Is this as expected?</li>
  <li>The cubic algorithm recently replaced reno as the Linux default.
Does it offer better performance? Is there any reason why the top
performing algorithm in your tests might not be the best default
choice? (Consider that many people run Linux on&nbsp;shared networks.)</li>
  <li>In case 8, are any of the algorithms using&nbsp;the maximum allowed bandwidth? Comment on this.</li>
  <li>Do any of the results surprise you? Do you think the results are accurate and repeatable?</li>
</ol>
You should also have a substantial amount of output from tcpprobe, but
this may be more difficult to interpret. Choose two algorithms, and for
each, plot the cwnd and ssthresh &nbsp;values for each test case as
line charts. (Hint: one of the aforementioned links contains scripts
that will help you do this using gnuplot.) For the two algorithms you
choose, include one or two "interesting" charts in your report. Comment
briefly on features of the chart, such as sections that exhibit cwnd
growth behavior characteristic of each algorithm.<br>
<br>
Finally, you should hand in all scripts used in generating your results.<br>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra Credit Part 3: Outsmarting Reset-based Denial of Service Attacks</span></h2>
This section of the assignment is in a preliminary stage, due to the
time expenditure required to implement and document parts 1 and 2.
However, the shell of this section seemed promising enough to merit
inclusion.<br>
<br>
The vulnerability of TCP to RST-based spoofing attacks in IPv4 is well
known, although recent events have once again brought these
vulnerabilities to prominence. <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4953.txt">Several&nbsp;solutions</a>
have been proposed, many of them quite simple. This part of the
assignment suggests partial implementation of one of these solutions.<br>
<br>
Initially I was hopeful that the current Linux TCP implementation would
be entirely modular, such that handling of RST packets could be
modified relatively easily and with minimal recompilation and
restarting. Unfortunately this is not the case. However, the
availability of raw sockets, which allow for user space construction
and examination of packet headers for IP and TCP, makes a user space
TCP implementation possible. Unfortunately, I was not able to find such
an implementation either, except in an early stage of development.<br>
<br>
As an alternative, students could implement a "bare bones" user space
TCP that offers safer handling of RST packets. Students should
implement only the connecting side of TCP; the listening side would be
provided by the instructor as a test driver. The student implementation
should include<br>
<ul>
  <li>Basic 3-way TCP handshake: the client should transmit a SYN
packet, receive and process the SYN-ACK response, and send the
confirming ACK.</li>
  <li>Implement the following "secure" variant of RST processing: the
client should respond only to a RST packet containing the initial
sequence number transmitted in the client's SYN packet. This makes a
valid RST packet more difficult to spoof by guessing the correct
sequence number, which can ordinarily fall within a large window.</li>
  <li>The client should print a simple message to the console when receiving a "spoofed" RST packet</li>
  <li>The client should extract and print to the console all packet
"payloads", but no more elaborate processing (transmission of acks,
ordering of packets by sequence number, etc.) is required</li>
</ul>
I believe that such an assignment would be finicky but probably less
time consuming than that described in part 2. I doubt many students
would use raw sockets subsequent to this assignment, but it would teach
something about TCP/IP. I apologize for the preliminary state of this
section, which does not have a corresponding solution.<br>
